# About Page

My portfolio [Maksim Sotnikov](https://...).

I am a Frontend developer with a focus on creating interactive and user-friendly web applications.  
My toolkit includes React, Redux, JavaScript, TypeScript, and much more to build scalable and maintainable
user interfaces.

My goal is to create intuitive and engaging web applications.
I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in web development to ensure that my work
remains relevant and effective. I believe that web development is not just about coding, but also about understanding
the needs of users and creating solutions that meet their requirements.
